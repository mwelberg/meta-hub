This repository contains a basic website powered by yii framework.
Some implemented features are:

* User descriptions
* Changes to profile

Some future features are:

* User profiles:
    * Profile image upload

* Multiple yii-modules:
    * prancing pony (drink list)
    * waffle list (todo list)
    * score board (for wargames)
    * event calendar

## Installation
TODO: Add required steps for installing the meta-hub

Before running the meta-hub, a directory ''uploads/images/profile/'' must be created in the project root.
User uploaded profile images would not be possible without it.
